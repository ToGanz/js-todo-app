##Vanilla JS ToDo App

ToDo App in Vanilla Javascript.

You can create projects and tasks within these projects. 

I created this as practice and to appreciate the functionalities of frameworks.
Adding event-listeners to dynamically created elements and rerendering felt a little hacky and I always had to pay attention to rerender when state changes.

The UI is responsive and I used mainly css-grid for that.
