## Vanilla JS ToDo App


ToDo App in Vanilla Javascript.

This is the first app in a series of apps I'm building. It will always
be the same app but build in different technologies.
Upcoming are a vue app and a rails app.

I created this as practice and to appreciate the functionalities of frameworks.
Adding event-listeners to dynamically created elements and rerendering felt a little hacky and I always had to pay attention to rerender when state changes.


The UI is responsive and I used mainly css-grid for that.
